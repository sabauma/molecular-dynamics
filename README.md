molecular-dynamics
==================

An event-driven molecular dynamics simulation of bubble cavitation
based off the work of Alexander Bass and Seth Putterman. This simulation
includes a more sophisticated model of the bubble wall that makes use of the
simulated gas particles to compute the pressure at the bubble wall, rather than
making use of idealized equations of state and also includes a higher order
approximation of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for modeling the motion of the
bubble wall.
