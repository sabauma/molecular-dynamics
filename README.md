molecular-dynamics
==================
An event-driven molecular dynamics simulation of bubble cavitation. This is based off the work of Alexander Bass and Seth Putterman. This simulation includes a more sophisticated model of the bubble wall that makes use of the simulated gas particles to compute the pressure at the bubble wall, rather than making use of idealized equations of state. This simulation also includes a higher order approximation of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
